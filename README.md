1. Multiple_Regression_UsedCars is a project aimed at predicting the price of second hand cars, based on multiple predictors. Features:
    - Linear Regression with multiple predictors;
    - Several performance checks: R-squared, R-squared adjusted, RMSE, MAE;
    - Coefficient analysis.
    
2. Classification_BorrowerClients is a project aimed at predicting whether new bank clients would accept a personal loan, by using 2 classification methods on historical client data (i.e. supervised). Features:
    - Logistical regression, improved using the ROC curve and AUC;
    - Decision Tree, improved using PRE-prunning and POST-prunning;
    - Several accuracy metrics: Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1 score, Cohen kappa;
    - Confusion matrices;
    - Feature importance extractor.
