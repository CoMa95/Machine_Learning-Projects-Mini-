1. Multiple_Regression_UsedCars is a project aimed at predicting the price of second hand cars, based on multiple predictors. Features:
    - Linear Regression with multiple predictors;
    - Several performance checks: R-squared, R-squared adjusted, RMSE, MAE;
    - Coefficient analysis.
    
2. Classification_BorrowerClients is a project aimed at predicting whether new bank clients would accept a personal loan, by using 2 classification methods on historical client data (i.e. supervised). Features:
    - Logistical regression, improved using the ROC curve and AUC;
    - Decision Tree, improved using PRE-prunning and POST-prunning;
    - Several accuracy metrics: Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1 score, Cohen kappa;
    - Confusion matrices;
    - Feature importance extraction.
    
   3. Classification(Bagging_Boosting)_Tourism used Ensemble techniques to classify the clients of a tourism company into those who would buy package holidays and those who wouldn't, for cost savings in advertisement. Features:
    - Simple Decision Tree (for comparison), improved using PRE-prunning with GridSearch, or using POST-prunning with Cost-Complexity analysis;
    - Bagging techniques, each improved using GridSearch: 
        a. Bagging Classifier;
        b. Random Forest CLassifier;
    - Boosting techniques, each improved using GridSearch:
        a. Ada Boost
        b. Gradient Boost
        c. XGBoost
    - Models evaluated using several accuracy metrics (Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1 score, Cohen Kappa) and confusion matrices;
    - Coefficient analysis and Feature Importance extraction.
